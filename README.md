# Mobile Adventures

This repository used to be called `BinaryAdventures`, which then changed to `SecurityAdventures`, and now `MobileAdventures`.
This is my all-in-one monorepo for all things mobile, including forward development, ARM-related stuff, and security testing.

## android
The `ios` directory will have Android-related items, both development and reverse engineering.

## arm
The `arm` directory will have arm-related items, which spans between Mach-O and ELF-based binary files.

## frida
The `frida` directory will have bespoke Frida "tricks" and experiments, spread around iOS, Android, etc..

## ios
The `ios` directory will have iOS-related items, both development and reverse engineering.

## web
The `web` directory will have web-related items, both development and reverse engineering.
