# Security Adventures

This repo originally served as a playground for learning more about actual "binary" (executable) analysis,
but has definitely outgrown that original purpose, and now includes really anything related to 
actual security "stuff"!


## frida

The `frida` directory will be my main workplace for 64-bit ARM-related hooking items.
My vision is to make it into some sort of "manual" where there will be tid-bits 
of my thoughts and experiments, each of which being broken down into pieces.
The current setup for testing is:
1. Raspberry Pi 4 - Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
2. Motorola G5s Plus Android 8.1
3. iPhone 8 iOS 16.2 (palera1n)
4. MacBook Pro 2022 16in

## Protocol Analysis
The `protocol_analysis` directory will include any work that has to do with analyzing 
different protocols. This includes binary protocols like Google's Protocol Buffers & LevelDB,
as well as special network protocols.
